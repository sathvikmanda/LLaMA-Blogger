# LLaMA-Blogger
📖 Overview

LLaMA-BlogGen is an AI-powered blog generation system that leverages LLaMA, a state-of-the-art large language model, to automatically create coherent, structured, and engaging blog posts from minimal prompts.

This project demonstrates how large language models (LLMs) can be harnessed for content creation, natural language generation (NLG), and AI-assisted writing.

✨ Features

📝 Automated Blog Generation – Generate complete blogs from a title, topic, or short description.
🧠 Context-Aware Writing – Maintains flow, coherence, and relevance across paragraphs.
⚡ Powered by LLaMA – Uses the latest transformer-based LLM for natural text generation.
🎨 Customizable Output – Choose tone, style, word count, and level of creativity.
🔗 Flexible Integration – Extendable for content pipelines, CMS systems, or APIs.
🚀 Getting Started

1️⃣ Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/llama-bloggen.git
cd llama-bloggen
2️⃣ Install Dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
Example dependencies might include:

transformers
torch
sentencepiece
streamlit  # Optional for UI
3️⃣ Run the Blog Generator
python llama.py
Provide a prompt or topic, and the model will generate a full-length blog post.

💡 Example Usage

from llama_bloggen import BlogGenerator

generator = BlogGenerator(model_path="path_to_llama_weights")
blog = generator.generate_blog(topic="The Future of Artificial Intelligence", style="informative", length="long")

print(blog)
Sample Output:

"Artificial Intelligence (AI) is rapidly transforming industries across the globe. From healthcare to autonomous vehicles, the integration of AI into everyday life is becoming inevitable..."
